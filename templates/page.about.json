With his catalogue and range expanding, he soon started manufacturing locally – including his own furniture range.</p><p>With no children to carry on business, his nephew Robert Macfarlane emigrated from Callander in Scotland to expand the business, which the Macfarlane family managed until the 1980s. </p><p>In 2017, Ian Macfarlane and his partner, Susie Wall, launched a new furniture company inspired by their entrepreneurial ancestor. Today, the reborn James Stewart brand is known for its enduring, collectible furniture, driven by the belief that good design should be made to last.</p>",
