Many of the inflammatory issues we deal with on the skin can be tied to a dysbiotic skin microbiome. The spores are a resilient bacteria that can help target overgrown strains on the skin and bring them down to a healthy level while also facilitating the growth of other beneficial strains- effectively balancing the skin microbiome.</p>"

The composition of the skin microbiome can directly affect the structure of the physical skin barrier. When this barrier becomes compromised, toxins can leak into the skin and cause inflammation throughout the body. Leaky skin is an independent risk factor for various other issues unrelated to skin health (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging).</p>"

It mainly happens through biofilms and max load capacity, which is based on weight/volume.

The serum works on the skin’s immune system, which is one of the main things the skin microbiome controls. When we have occasional inflammatory issues, it’s an overworking of the immune system. This means the skin is reacting to things that it should not be reacting to, which is triggered by a dysbiotic skin microbiome.</p>"

Make sure to wait 30 seconds to a minute before applying water-based products on top of SIV to ensure they can be absorbed. Finish with moisturizer.*Leave- on benzoyl peroxide should ALWAYS be applied last.</p>"
